(Developing with Houdini20.5 and Python3.11 on Windows11, tested on the Rocky Linux)
## Use
1. Put `ui` and `pypanel` files in your `$HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR/python_panels` (create `python_panels` if you don't have one)
2. Open Houdini -> Pane Tab Type -> Misc -> Python Panel -> should showing in the drop down menu on the left top


**Notes:**

The UI and idea are inspired by Adrien Lambert’s [tutorial](https://adrienlambert.gumroad.com/l/pythfx) screenshot: https://public-files.gumroad.com/qwi7g0w0e4lf25qyrm52cbq25dxw
The code is my own-made since I don’t have access to the tutorial.
